# Black Overlay Extension

A chrome extension to create an overlay above all webpages to give the effect of changing brightness. Useful for when viewing bright webpages and the screen's brightness cannot be changed (Eg: An external monitor).

I am a Computer Science Engineering student and spend most of my time studying from my laptop which is connected to an external monitor. Since the external monitor's brightness does not change despite changing it on my laptop, studying from a white PDF for a long time hurts my eyes and that's why I built this extension. 

It's my **first time** using *JavaScript* and creating an extension so it was a fun side project as well!

## How to use the extension?

1. Clone this repository! <br>
Using SSH: `git clone git@github.com:mokshablr/Black-Overlay-Extension.git`<br>
Using HTTP: `https://github.com/mokshablr/Black-Overlay-Extension.git`

2. Go to your browser settings and find extensions. (or type `chrome://extensions` on chrome)

3. Click on "load unpacked" in the top left and select the cloned repository.

Great! You should now be able see the "Black Overlay" extension along with your other extensions! Make sure you enable it and then go to any website to see the overlay!

You could pin the extension so that it pops up on your browser from where you can change the opacity of the overlay!
